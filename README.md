This work was mainly inspired by github.com/fzipp/gocyclo

# godepth
Count the maxdepth of go functions

# examples:

    $ godepth .
    $ godepth -over 3
    $ godepth -avg

# history

One of my use case was to test the deepness of go functions for code reviews.
I didn't find any tools that fulfill the requirement.
